#	Runs an RL-Viz App Experiment
#


#Don't let this be too scary for you, it's not as bad as it looks.  Running an experiment consists of starting 4 different programs:
#	- RL_glue executable
#	- EnvironmentShell -- looks for environments in JAR files wherever you tell it to
#	- AgentShell  -- looks for agents in JAR files wherever you tell it to
#	- RLVizApp  -- application that runs a graphically driven experiment


 
# The fact that we're starting all 4 parts in a regular way is what makes this look complicated.  This files sources (includes)
#  /system/scripts/rl-library-includes.sh
# If you check out that file you'll see there is no magic.
# We just use the scripts instead of invokings things manually so the script can sometimes take care of 
# platform specific idiosyncracies (like Cygwin stuff).

#We'll actually provide the Linux invokations in Linux, so you can not use the script if you want.
