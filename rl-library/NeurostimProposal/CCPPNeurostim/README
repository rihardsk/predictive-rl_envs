Description:

  This simulator is designed as a teaching and testing tool for
  adaptive neurostimulation research and epilepsy therapy. The source
  is divided into three parts: core, system, and utility.  The core
  sources are the high-level RL-Glue executables: Environment, Agent,
  Experiment. The system source defines the simulation engine (see
  ATTRIBUTION).  The utility source defines matrix/vector operations
  as well as a KD-tree implementation (see ATTRIBUTION) used by the
  simulation engine.
  
  This example requires that the RL-Glue Core has been installed.
  The C/C++ Codec is not necessary.
  
Getting started:

  Libraries:

	This software requires lapack, Boost and the Boost numeric 
	bindings (not an official part of the boost library). 
	Information on obtaining a copy of this source can be found here:

    http://www.opentissue.org/wikitissue/index.php/Boost_bindings

  Compiling:
  
    Depending on whether you have RL-Glue Core in your include and
    library paths, you may have to update the Makefile or not.  If the
    installation was to the default location, this Makefile may not
    need to be edited. If you have to update the Makefile, set the -I
    and -L for CFLAGS and LDFLAGS to point to where you installed the
    headers and libs. Also, set BOOST to point to the boost directory.

		$> make

  Executing:
  
  	Compile First! (above)
  	
	**RL-Glue Core**

		$> ./Neurostim

	**C/C++ Codec**
	
	  These instructions assume that you have rl_glue (or rl_glue.exe)
	  installed on your path so that you don't have to type the full
	  path to it.

	  Execute the following commands in different console/terminal
	  windows: #If you want to do them in the same terminal
	  window, #append an ampersand & to each line
	  
		$> ./NeurostimAgent
		$> ./NeurostimEnvironment
		$> ./NeurostimExperiment
		$> rl_glue #(maybe rl_glue.exe)
