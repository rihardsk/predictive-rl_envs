Wumpus World Environment (Java)
-------------------------------
The source code attached with this project includes the sample experiment from Brian Tanner and the default Random Agent from Brian Tanner too. You can easily run the environment, experiment and agent from by just compiling the source code and the output will be shown immediately on the console. 

I only put the Jar files of the environment as the Agent and experiment can be easily downloaded from their original sources (RL-glue). The source code includes them to make the life simpler for people who are going to use the project (Just replace the experiment and the Agent).
