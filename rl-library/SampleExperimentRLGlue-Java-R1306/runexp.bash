#	Runs an RL-Glue experiment without any RL-Viz fancies.
#


#Don't let this be too scary for you, it's not as bad as it looks.  Running an experiment consists of starting 4 different programs:
#	- RL_glue executable
#	- Environment
#	- Agent
#	- Experiment

# The fact that we're starting all 4 parts in a regular way is what makes this look complicated.  This files sources (includes)
#  /system/scripts/rl-library-includes.sh
# If you check out that file you'll see there is no magic.
